## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS/SCSS

### Continued development

What I want to focus on in the near future is understanding sass/css and it's various syntaxes because of how vast and feature rich it is.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me to understand syntaxes of different properties and values. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- (https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me  understand why some workflow methods are better than others. Like how when dealing with online fonts, it's better to use a link tag in the html than importing with the css because the browser favors the former more than the latter. I'd recommend it to anyone who writes code.
